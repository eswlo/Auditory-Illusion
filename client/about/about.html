                    A fascinating topic within the broader field of auditory perception, 
                    auditory illusion has attracted the attention of researchers and scholars 
                    from a wide range of disciplines, such as psychology, neuroscience, and music. 
                    With a pedagogical goal in mind, this project was created to provide users with 
                    a more engaging means to experience, explore, and gain a more nuanced understanding of 
                    the topic. It was inspired in part by my graduate studies and teaching at Columbia, 
                    where my interaction with relevant materials resulted in the realization that most of the demonstrations 
                    available were pre-made. This observation eventually led to my plan of leveraging 
                    computing technology (in particular, Web Audio frameworks) and programming to model and synthesize these phenomena in 
                    real-time, hoping to facilitate students' learning, instructors' teaching, other 
                    educational aspects, etc.<br><br>

                    Currently, there are three types of auditory illusion included in this project: 
                    stream segregation (based on spectral peak position), scale illusion, and 
                    octave illusion. The first one was drawn from Al Bregman's experiments, while the other 
                    two came from Diana Deutsch's research on illusions. 
                    More selected demonstrations will be implemented continuously.<br><br>

                    Special thanks to Prof. Brad Garton for sparking my interest in the application 
                    of Web Audio frameworks, and to Prof. Fred Lerdahl for guiding me to explore the 
                    intersection of cognition and sound.

                A classically trained composer, Shih-Wei Lo has had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed 
                musicians and ensembles, receiving a number of prestigious awards and recognitions, and having his work 
                performed at renowned festivals and venues. Despite his extensive training in music, Lo has maintained a great level 
                of curiosity toward science and computing technology. After obtaining his Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) at Columbia 
                and working as a freelance composer for a few years, Lo decided to return to school in order to develope a strong foundation 
                and competency in computing and software engineering. He is currently pursuing a degree in computer science at the University of 
                British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.
